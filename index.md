## Anton Timofeev

In my more than 9-year career as a software developer, I have been focusing on developing clean, scalable and maintainable code. I enjoy forming, leading and working in teams as well as delivering projects independently. I particularly enjoy developing services using Neural Language Processing and Machine Learning (NLP/ML), as well as general Python back end services.
